/***
 *  There are N buckets (5 < N < 105), each with a certain capacity Ci (1 â‰¤ Ci < 100). One
    day, after a rainstorm, each bucket is filled with Ai units of water (1 â‰¤ Ai < Ci). Charlie
    then performs the following process: he pours bucket 1 into bucket 2, then bucket 2 into
    bucket 3, and so on, up until pouring bucket N - 1 into bucket N. When Charlie pours
    bucket B into bucket B + 1, he pours as much as possible until bucket B is empty or bucket
    B + 1 is full. Find out how much water is in each bucket once Charlie is done pouring.
